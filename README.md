Bootstrapped using [nano-react-app](https://github.com/adrianmcli/nano-react-app).

- `yarn start` â€” This will spawn a development server with a default port of `1234`.

You can use the `-p` flag to specify a custom port. 

```
yarn start -- -p 3000
```

Some things are unfinished because I ran out of time:
- User registration
- Error on deleting list items and list with nested items. List with no items is okay
- No singular item view
